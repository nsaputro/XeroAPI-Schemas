Xero API XSD Schemas
====================

This repository contains a set of XSD schemas that can be used with the [Xero API](http://api.xero.com). Xero provide [online accounting software](http://www.xero.com/) for businesses. For more information on connecting to the API, see the [Xero Developer Centre](http://developer.xero.com/).

**Please Note** These XSD schemas are provided as a guide for the XML that is read/written to the Xero API. They can be used to generate client-side object models for use with the Xero API, but we don't currently recommend that you use them to validate each xml request and response message to the API.
